## Topic

Predicting employee attrition.

### Why?

Given the conversation today around workplace burnout and "quite quitting" we were interested to see if we can predict the probability of an employee quiting based on key factors.

Data:

•	Demographic Information

o	Employee Id – Unique id for survey participant

o	Date Joined – Date hired by company

o	Gender – Male, Female, on Unknown

o	Company Type – Designated between service oriented and product oriented

o	WFH Setup Available – Yes allowed for work from home

o	Designation – 1 to 5 with 1 being lower status and 5 being highest status

•	Survey Responses

o	Resource Allocation – 1 low resource available and 10 means high number of resources available

o	Mental Fatigue Score – 0 means no fatigue and 10 means completely fatigue

o	Burn Rate – 0 to 100 with 100 being highest level of burnout

Objective:

•	Can we predict the likelihood of an employee quitting?

o	Based on data we can find, which type of machine learning will be utilized?

	Unsupervised – Outcome is not known

o	What type of database are we considering?

	PostSQL

•	What additional data to use in order to fully use Post SQL?

o	Will the data require clean-up?

	Based on the data we have reviewed thus far; we anticipate running the CSV file through Python to clean-up the data for use.

	New data frame will be created with cleaned data and exported to a CSV file.

o	What kind of visualizations are we considering?

	Potentially use of Tableau for the story telling.

•	Compare demographical information to the survey responses

•	Demographical information to use:

o	Gender

o	Company type

o	WFH

o	Designation

o	Other items

	Can we find data on remote working?

•	Other Topics?
